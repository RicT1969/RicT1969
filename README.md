<p>I am delighted to share that I have recently finished a six month Data Analytics Bootcamp through Monsah University.</p>
<p>The course looked at all stages of data analysis, thorugh extraction, transformation and loading, to analysis, statistical and machine learing modelling and data visualisation.</p>
<p>My repository contains the projects and assignments taken thoughout this course, from use of VBA within excel spreadsheets, Python programming (including the following libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, GeoPandas), data visualisation using Java Script, data gathering using Beautiful Soup and APIs and Flask, data storage and querying using postgresSQL and Pysql, and nonSQL databases using MongoDB and Pymongo.</p>
<p>Additionally, we explored data visualiation using Tableau, and I have additonally used PowerBI at work.</p>
<p>Finally, we explored machine learning, using Scikit-learn and TensorFlow, exploring unsupervised and supervised machine learning and neural networks.</p>
